abstract: Gowalla is a location-based social networking website where users share their locations by checking-in. The friendship network is undirected and was collected using their public API, and consists of 196591 nodes and 950327 edges. It has a total of 6,442,890 check-ins of these users over the period of Feb. 2009 - Oct. 2010. The aim of the project is to use Data Science tools to analyse and build a recommendation system for both the geospatial checkins and the social network links in that database. As a part of the project I will  tag a users as a locals or tourists (who mostly visit monuments, stay in hotels ...) and adapt responses given that tag. I will use the 17400 Paris check-ins from 1366 users and I will join Gowalla location data with Google Places to separate the type of venues reported Gowalla's users.

Faiss handles collections of vectors of a fixed dimensionality d, typically a few 10s to 100s. These collections can be stored in matrices. We assume row-major storage, ie. the j'th component of vector number $i$ is stored in row $i$, column $j$ of the matrix. Faiss uses only 32-bit floating point matrices.
